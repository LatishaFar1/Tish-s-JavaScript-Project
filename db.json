            "summary":"Thor's adopted brother and the god of mischief, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. This is an alternate, 'time variant' version of Loki who created a new timeline in Avengers: Endgame (2019) beginning in 2012. Because of this, he has not gone through the events of Thor: The Dark World (2013) or Thor: Ragnarok (2017), which reformed the previously villainous character before his death in Avengers: Infinity War (2018). Head writer Michael Waldron compared Loki to Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs since both were adopted and love being in control. Hiddleston expressed interest in returning to the role in order to explore Loki's powers, particularly his shapeshifting, which plays into the series' exploration of identity. The series focuses more on Loki's capabilities with magic, such as telekinesis and firing magic blasts.[9] Loki's sex in the series is denoted by the Time Variance Authority as 'fluid', referencing the character's genderfluidity in Marvel Comics that had previously been speculated on for the MCU given his shapeshifting ability.[10][11] Waldron said he was aware of how many people identify with Loki and were 'eager for that representation'. The series also reveals Loki as bisexual, becoming the first major queer character in the MCU" ,

(1982). Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige noted that the character is similar to Wilson in that he is unfazed by the MCU; Hiddleston helped Wilson prepare for the role by explaining and showing him moments from the MCU films, which Wilson felt was useful for when Mobius interviews Loki in the series. Wilson and Herron examined Good Will Hunting (1997) as inspiration for Mobius being a mentor and therapist for Loki who still pushes him.",
